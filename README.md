### Details
- Cryptowatch was created as an easy intuitive way to track and manage your crypto assets
- No actual money is involved, so you can rest easy knowing your investments are actually held wherever you choose
- Use Cryptowatch as an investment sandbox to test the waters before actually investing
- Track your overall portfolio performance in one single place at the glance of an eye

### Usage
- Register an account to keep your portfolio on reoccuring visits
- Search for your invested crypto asset and select it from the list
- Cryptowatch will automagically populate the price from the current day, but if you are adding an investment from a previous date, select that date from the calendar pop up
- Enter the amount of crypto you bought and hit add to portfolio! That investment will now be saved to the portfolio.
- Clicking an investment in the portfolio section will toggle the lot information about that asset.
- To add another lot of the same asset, click the asset in your portfolio first to bring it up in the details section, and then click add another lot!
- Your current total portfolio value as well as the 24hr and overall loss/gain is displayed at the top of the portfolio section.

### Stack
- Created using a modified MERN stack
- MongoDB, Express, React/Redux and NodeJS
- Any additions are welcome via a PR
